# Auto-Generated Spring Boot Application

This project is an example Spring Boot application automatically generated based on a provided database schema. It includes RESTful APIs for managing the defined entities.

## Prerequisites

* Java Development Kit (JDK) - Version 17 or later (as specified in `pom.xml`)
* Apache Maven - Version 3.6.x or later (for building the project)
* An IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code with Java extensions) is recommended.
* (Optional) A database client if you want to connect to and inspect the database directly (e.g., DBeaver, pgAdmin if using PostgreSQL).

## Project Structure (Typical)

The LLM will generate a standard Spring Boot project structure, which typically includes:

* `src/main/java/com/example/generated/`
    * `YourApplicationNameApplication.java`: The main Spring Boot application class.
    * `model/`: Contains JPA entity classes (e.g., `User.java`, `Product.java`).
    * `repository/`: Contains Spring Data JPA repository interfaces (e.g., `UserRepository.java`).
    * `service/`: Contains business logic service classes (e.g., `UserService.java`).
    * `controller/` (or `web/rest/`): Contains REST controller classes (e.g., `UserController.java`).
    * `dto/` (or `payload/`): Contains Data Transfer Objects for API requests/responses.
    * `exception/` (optional): For custom exception classes (e.g., `ResourceNotFoundException.java`).
* `src/main/resources/`
    * `application.properties` (or `application.yml`): Application configuration (database, server port, etc.).
    * `static/`: For static web assets (if any).
    * `templates/`: For server-side view templates (if any, less common for pure REST APIs).
* `src/test/java/`: For unit and integration tests.
* `pom.xml`: Maven project configuration file.

## Configuration

1.  **Database**:
    * By default, the application might be configured to use an in-memory database like H2 (check `src/main/resources/application.properties`).
    * If you want to use a different database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL):
        * Ensure the database server is running.
        * Create the database if it doesn't exist.
        * Update the database connection properties in `src/main/resources/application.properties`:
            * `spring.datasource.url`
            * `spring.datasource.username`
            * `spring.datasource.password`
            * `spring.jpa.database-platform` (or `spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect`)
        * Make sure the corresponding database driver dependency is present in `pom.xml`.

2.  **Application Properties**: Review `src/main/resources/application.properties` for any other configurations you might want to adjust (e.g., `server.port`).

## Building and Running the Application

1.  **Navigate to the Project Root**:
    Open a terminal or command prompt and go to the root directory of this generated project (where `pom.xml` is located).

2.  **Build the Project using Maven**:
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```
    This command will compile the code, run any tests, and package the application (typically into a JAR file in the `target/` directory).

3.  **Run the Application**:
    There are a few ways to run the Spring Boot application:
    * **Using Maven Spring Boot Plugin**:
        ```bash
        mvn spring-boot:run
        ```
    * **Running the Executable JAR (after building)**:
        ```bash
        java -jar target/your-application-name-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar 
        ```
        (Replace `your-application-name-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` with the actual JAR file name found in the `target/` directory).
    * **From your IDE**: Most IDEs allow you to directly run the main application class (`YourApplicationNameApplication.java`).

4.  **Accessing the Application**:
    * Once started, the application will typically be available at `http://localhost:8080` (or the port configured in `application.properties`).
    * The REST APIs will be available under their respective paths (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/your-entities`).
    * API documentation (Swagger UI) should be available at a path like `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html` (if `springdoc-openapi` is included and configured).

## API Endpoints

The LLM will generate API endpoints based on the entities in your schema. Typically, for each entity, you will find CRUD operations:

* `POST /api/v1/{entities}`: Create a new entity.
* `GET /api/v1/{entities}`: Get a list of all entities.
* `GET /api/v1/{entities}/{id}`: Get a specific entity by its ID.
* `PUT /api/v1/{entities}/{id}`: Update an existing entity.
* `DELETE /api/v1/{entities}/{id}`: Delete an entity.

Refer to the generated controller classes and the Swagger UI for detailed endpoint information.

## Further Development

* Implement more complex business logic in the service layer.
* Add security features using Spring Security.
* Write comprehensive unit and integration tests.
* Set up proper database schema management for production (e.g., using Flyway or Liquibase) instead of relying on `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update`.
